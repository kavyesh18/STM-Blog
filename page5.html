            <h1>Applications of Path Testing in Software Testing Methodologies
            </h1>

            <ol>
                <li><b>1.Integration, Coverage and Paths in called Components:</b></li>
                <p>Path testing methods are mainly used in unit testing, especially for new software
                    The new component is first tested as an independent unit with all called components and co-requisite components replaced by stubs. A simulator of low-level components that is more reliable than the actual component
                    Path testing clarifies the integration issues
                    C1 coverage at the system level ranges from 50% to 85%
                    We gave no statistics for C2 coverage in system testing because it is impossible to monitor C2 coverage without disrupting the system's operation
                    Note:
                    Co-requisite: A formal course of study required to be taken simultaneously with another</p>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li> <b> 2.New Code:</b>
                    <p>New code should always be subjected to enough path testing to achieve C2
                        Stubs are used where it is clear that the bug potential for the stub is significantly lower than that of the called components
                        Old, trusted components will not be replaced by stubs
                        Some consideration is given to paths within called components
                        Typically, we will try to use the shortest entry/exit path that will do the task</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li> <b>3.Maintenance:</b></li>

                <p>There is a great difference between maintenance testing and new code testing
                    Maintenance testing is a completely different situation
                    It involves modifications which are accommodated in the system, as required
                    Path testing is used firstly on the modified component</p>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li><b>4.Rehosting:</b></li>

                <p>Path testing with C1+C2 coverage is a powerful tool for rehosting old software
                    We get a very powerful, effective, rehosting process when C1+C2 coverage is used in conjunction with automatic or semiautomatic structural test generators
                    Software is rehosted because it is no longer cost effective to support the environment in which it runs
                    The objective of rehosting is to change the operating environment and not the rehosted software
                    Rehosting from one COBOL environment to another is easy by comparison
                    Rehosted software can be modified to improve efficiency and/or to implement new functionality, which had been difficult in the old environments
                    The test suites(collection) and all outcomes of the old environment become the specification for the rehosted software</p>
