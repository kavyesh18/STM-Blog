            <h1>Consequences of Bugs in Software Testing Methodologies</h1>

            <p>The consequences of a bug can be measured in terms of human, rather than machine, Some consequences of a bug on a scale of one to ten are:</p>

            <p>1. Mild: The symptoms of the bug offend us gently; a misspelled output or a misaligned printout</p>
            <p>2. Moderate: Outputs are misleading or redundant. The bug impacts the systems performance</p>
            <p>3. Annoying: The Systems behaviour, because of the bug is dehumanizing <br>
                Example: Names are truncated or arbitrarily modified</p>
            <p>4. Disturbing: It refuses to handle legitimate (authorized/legal) transactions. <br>
               <b>Example: The ATM wont give money. Credit card is declared invalid </b></p>
            <p>5. Serious: It loses track of its transaction. Not just the transaction itself but the fact that the transaction occurred and accountability is lost</p>
            <p>6. Very Serious: The bug causes the system to do the wrong transactions. Instead of gaining a pay check, the system credits it to another account or converts deposits to withdrawals</p>
            <p>7. Extreme: The problems are not limited to a few users or to few transaction types. They are frequent and arbitrary, ( instead of occasionally infrequent) or for unusual case</p>
            <p>8. Intolerable: Long term unrecoverable corruption of the database occurs and the corruption is not easily discovered. Serious consideration is given to shutting the system down</p>
            <p>9. Catastrophic: The decision to shut down is taken out of our hands because the system fails</p>
            <p>10. Infectious: What can be worse than a failed system? One that corrupts other systems even though it does not fail in itself; that erodes the social physical environment; that melts reactors and starts a war</p>

            <h1>Taxonomy of Bugs</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>1.There is no universally correct way to categorize bugs. The taxonomy is not rigid</li>
                <li>2.A given bug can be put into one or another category depending on its history and the programmers state of mind</li>
                <li>3.The major Categories are:</li>
