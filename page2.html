            <h1>Introduction:</h1>
            <p>Testing is the most time consuming, but a needful activity of a software project. It is vital to the success of new system.The main Purpose of testing is to:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>1.Measure the quality of the software</li>
                <li>2.Find out the faults in the application and software</li>
                <li>3.Reduce the number of bugs in the program.</li>
                <li>4.Check all the requirements and specifications given by client and customers are met or not.</li>
                <li>5.Produce a product which is full of quality oriented.</li>
                <li>6.Comfort the need of client and customers.</li>
                <li>7.Provide a defect and error free software.</li>
                <li>8.Check whether the application is working as per the functional requirement specified or not.</li>
                <li>9.Carry the difference between the expected and actual results.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1 class="phase">
                Phases of Testing:
            </h1>
            <h4>
                Phase 0: Until 1956: (Debugging Oriented):
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1.There is no difference between testing and debugging</li>
                <li>2.Phase 0 thinking was the norm in early days of software development till testing emerged as a discipline</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Phase 1: 1957-1978: (Demonstration Oriented):
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1.The purpose of testing here is to show that software works</li>
                <li>2.Highlighted during the late 1970's</li>
                <li>3.This failed because the probability of showing that software work 'decreases' as testing increases. i.e. the more the test, the more likely a bug is found</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
                Phase 2: 1979-1982: (Destruction Oriented):
            </h4>

            <ul>
                <li>1.The purpose of testing is to show that software doesn't work</li>
                <li>2.This phase also failed because the software is never released, as we find one bug or the other. Also a bug corrected may also lead to another bug</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
                Phase 3: 1983-1987: (Evaluation Oriented):
            </h4>

            <ul>
                <li>1.The purpose of testing is not to prove anything but to reduce the perceived risk of not working to an acceptable value (Statistical Quality Control)</li>
                <li>2.Notion is that testing does improve the product, to the extent that testing catches bugs, and to the extent that those bugs are fixed</li>
                <li>3.The product is released when the confidence on that product is high enough ( Note: This is applied to large software products with millions of code years of use)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
                Phase 4: 1988-2000: (Prevention Oriented):
            </h4>

            <ul>
                <li>1.Testability is the factor considered here, Once reason is to reduce the labour of testing</li>
                <li>2.Other reason is to check the testable and non-testable code</li>
                <li>3.Testable code has fewer bugs than the code that's hard to test</li>
                <li>4.Identifying the testing techniques to test the code is the main key here</li>
            </ul>
